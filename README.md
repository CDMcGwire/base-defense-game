# base-defense-game

A 2D game in the style of the old flash classic (at least to Kongregate users) Elona Shooter made in the Unity engine.

The directory with all of the game's custom C# scripts can be found under [/Assets/scripts](https://github.com/CDMcGwire/base-defense-game/tree/master/Assets/scripts).

The latest stable build of the game can be found here: https://cdmcgwire.itch.io/esc-alpha
